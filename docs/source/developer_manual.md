# Developer Manual

This documentation manual is designed for people looking to develop their own models, processes or studies in SoSTrades, leveraging all extended capabilities of its execution and configuration engine. 

SoSTrades is a web-based, multi-user, interactive publication-quality graph simulation platform. It allows users to drop new modules without additional coding, and provides embedded advanced numerical capabilities for simulation and multi-disciplinary optimization.

Learn how to create a wrapper for one of your Python model, define your I/O variables, create your post-processings, combine wrapper in processes, configure your own studies with SoSTrades capabilities.
